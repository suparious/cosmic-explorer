# Modal Load Issue Fix

## Problem
When starting a new game, players see a "Load Game?" modal that shouldn't appear. Additionally, the close button (Ã—) appears in the top-left instead of top-right corner.

## Analysis
1. The "Load Game?" modal comes from `SaveLoadModal.loadFromSlot()` method
2. This method should only be called when loading an existing save
3. Something is triggering this method on new game start
4. The close button CSS needs to be fixed to ensure right alignment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Close Button CSS
Added `left: auto !important;` to force right alignment of the close button in `/static/css/game.css`.

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added console logging to:
- `loadFromSlot()` method to trace when it's called
- `startNewGame()` method to track game initialization

### 3. Possible Causes
The issue might be caused by:
- A click event being triggered on a save slot element
- An auto-load feature trying to load slot 0 (autosave)
- A race condition during initialization

## Temporary Workaround
Since ESC key now works to dismiss the modal, players can press ESC when the modal appears on new game start.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor console logs to identify what's calling `loadFromSlot()`
2. Check for any auto-load functionality that might be triggering on new game
3. Ensure no DOM elements are being clicked programmatically on startup

## Testing Instructions
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "New Journey"
4. Check console for debug messages showing what triggered `loadFromSlot()`
5. Report the stack trace from the console
