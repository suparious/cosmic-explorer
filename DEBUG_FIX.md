## üîç Debug Summary

The JavaScript error you're seeing happens because the onclick handlers in the HTML are trying to access `gameUI` and `gameEngine` before they exist. I've fixed this by:

1. **Added safety checks** to all onclick handlers:
   - Changed `onclick="gameUI.startNewGame()"` to `onclick="if(window.gameUI) gameUI.startNewGame()"`
   - Same for all other button handlers

2. **Added debug logging** to track initialization:
   - UIManager constructor logs when screens are loaded
   - GameEngine.init() logs each step
   - Main.js has better error handling

3. **Fixed initialization order**:
   - Global references are set AFTER initialization completes
   - Added null checks before using global objects

## üöÄ Try Again Now!

1. **Stop the server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart it**:
   ```bash
   python api/app.py
   ```
3. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Check the browser console** for the new debug messages

The game should now:
- Show "Initializing ship systems..." briefly
- Log initialization steps in console
- Successfully show the main menu after 2 seconds
- Have working menu buttons

If it still doesn't work, please share the new console output - the debug messages will tell us exactly where it's failing!
