# Escape Pod Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete escape pod system for Cosmic Explorer that adds a critical survival mechanic to the game. When a player's ship is destroyed, if they own an escape pod, they can continue playing in a vulnerable pod mode where they must navigate to safety.

## Key Features Implemented

### Backend Mechanics (api/app.py)
- **Pod Purchase**: Players can buy an escape pod for 500 wealth at repair locations
- **Pod Activation**: When ship reaches 0 HP, pod automatically activates if owned
- **Pod Stats**: Pod has 30 HP maximum (very low as requested)
- **Pod Damage**: 30% chance to take 10 damage during each navigation
- **Pod Mode**: Special game state with limited actions
- **Ship Purchase**: Can buy new ship for 400 wealth when at repair location in pod mode
- **Distress Signal**: Can attempt to send distress signal (20% chance of getting 100 wealth)

### Visual Representation (renderer.js)
- **Pod on Ship**: Visual pod attachment shown as glowing orange sphere when owned
- **Pod Mode**: Dedicated pod rendering with:
  - Energy shield that changes color based on HP (cyan → yellow → red)
  - Thruster effects showing pod movement
  - Critical warning when HP < 30%
  - Damage shake effect when hit
- **Pod Ejection**: Dramatic ship explosion and pod ejection animation

### UI Integration (ui.js, index.html, game.css)
- **Pod Indicator**: "Pod Ready" indicator when pod is owned
- **Pod HP Display**: Ship condition bar converts to pod HP in pod mode
- **Dynamic Buttons**: 
  - "Buy Pod" button appears at repair locations
  - "Buy Ship" button appears in pod mode at repair locations
- **Disabled Actions**: Most actions disabled in pod mode (only navigate available)
- **Visual Styling**: Pod-themed orange/gold colors for pod UI elements

### Gameplay Experience
1. **Before Pod**: Player can purchase pod at any repair location for 500 wealth
2. **Pod Ownership**: Visual indicator on ship and in UI shows pod is ready
3. **Ship Destruction**: Dramatic explosion effect and pod ejection animation
4. **Pod Mode**: 
   - Limited to navigation only
   - Each move has 30% chance of damage
   - Must reach planet/outpost before pod is destroyed
   - Erratic, slower movement compared to ship
5. **Recovery**: At repair location, can buy new ship and continue adventure

## Technical Highlights
- Fully integrated with existing game state management
- WebSocket real-time updates for pod events
- Smooth animations and particle effects
- Responsive UI that adapts to pod mode
- Proper error handling and state validation

## Player Strategy
The pod adds strategic depth:
- Players must decide if 500 wealth for pod is worth the insurance
- In pod mode, players face tough choices (risk navigation vs distress signal)
- Creates tension as players race to safety with limited HP
- Pod is consumed when used, requiring another purchase

This implementation makes the pod a compelling risk/reward mechanic that enhances the survival aspect of Cosmic Explorer!
