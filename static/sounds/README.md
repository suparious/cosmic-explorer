# ðŸ”Š Cosmic Explorer Sound System

## This Directory is Intentionally Empty

**All sounds in Cosmic Explorer are procedurally generated using the Web Audio API.**

### Why No Sound Files?

1. **Zero Loading Time** - No files to download
2. **Infinite Variety** - Sounds can vary based on context
3. **Small Package Size** - No audio assets to store
4. **Dynamic Generation** - Sounds adapt to game state

### How It Works

All sound effects are created in real-time by `/static/js/audio.js` using:
- Web Audio API oscillators (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle waves)
- Noise generation for explosions and effects
- Envelope shaping for realistic sound dynamics
- Filters and effects for variety

### Current Sound Effects (June 2025)

âœ… **Fully Implemented Sounds:**
- Navigation/warp drive effects
- Scanning sounds
- Repair sounds
- Alert/warning sounds (low/high/critical severity)
- Success chimes
- Laser weapon sounds
- Missile launch sounds
- Precise shot (focused beam)
- Barrage (rapid fire)
- Explosion effects
- Item pickup sounds (common/uncommon/rare)
- UI click feedback
- Purchase/sell sounds
- Quest accept/complete fanfares
- Achievement sounds
- Low fuel/health warnings
- Docking sounds

### Music System

The game also features a sophisticated **procedural music engine** (`/static/js/musicEngine.js`) that creates:
- Eve Online-style ambient space music
- 5 dynamic tracks (exploration, station, danger, combat, pod)
- Layered synthesis with drones, pads, and effects
- Smooth transitions based on game state

### Testing Sounds

You can test any sound in the browser console:
```javascript
// Test weapon sounds
window.audioManager.playWeaponSound('missile_launcher');

// Test item pickups
window.audioManager.playItemPickup(500); // Rare item

// Test other sounds
window.audioManager.playUIClick();
window.audioManager.playQuestCompleteSound();
window.audioManager.playDockingSound();
```

### For Future Developers

**DO NOT** add sound files to this directory. If you need new sounds:
1. Add a new method to `/static/js/audio.js`
2. Use Web Audio API to generate the sound procedurally
3. Follow the existing patterns for consistency
