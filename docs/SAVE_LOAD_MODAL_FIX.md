# Save/Load Modal Persistence Fix - June 6, 2025

## Issue Description
When loading a saved game, notifications and choice modals from the previous game state (such as questions from selling items) were persisting and appearing after the load completed. This created a confusing user experience where old UI elements from a different game session would appear.

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. WebSocket events with choices (e.g., from selling items) would create choice modals
2. When loading a save, these modals weren't being properly cleared
3. The modal state was persisting across game sessions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Modal Cleanup in `loadFromSlot()`
```javascript
// Close all modals and clear notifications before loading
this.closeAllModals();
document.querySelectorAll('.notification').forEach(notif => notif.remove());

// Small delay to ensure modals are fully closed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
```

### 2. Improved `closeAllModals()` Function
- Now clears choice modal content to prevent stale data
- Resets the active modals tracking array
- Resets modal z-index to base value
- Ensures complete cleanup of modal state

### 3. Updated `showScreen()` Method
- Added a small delay after closing modals before switching screens
- Ensures modals are fully removed before UI transitions

## Files Modified
- `/static/js/ui.js` - Updated modal management functions

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start a new game
2. Navigate to a trade location
3. Sell an item (a choice modal should appear)
4. While the modal is open, save the game
5. Load a different save
6. Verify that no old modals or notifications appear

## Prevention
For future development:
- Always clear UI state when loading saves
- Don't persist transient UI elements in game state
- Ensure modal cleanup is thorough and includes content clearing
- Add delays when necessary to ensure DOM updates complete
