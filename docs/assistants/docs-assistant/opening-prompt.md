# Opener

I need you to help me update the documentation for Cosmic Explorer, in the `/home/shaun/repos/cosmic-explorer` directory.
I've just finished working with several Coding Assistants, and I've asked each of them to summarize their work in the `docs/` folder.
I've also asked each of them to clean-up the `README.md` file.

Please review the `docs/` folder and the `README.md` file, and make any improvements or housekeeping that I may have missed.
