# Opener

Use your tools and take a look at my project in: `/home/shaun/repos/cosmic-explorer` directory. I took all the summary documents that each of the previous coding assistants worked on in this game, at the end of our conversations, and organised them the best i could into the `docs/` folder. For example, I found an icon generator, so I put that in `tools/` and I tried to clean-up the `README.md` file. Please review my currently working game and then make any improvements or housekeeping that I may have missed. If everything looks good, then let's work on the feature enhancements mentioning in the game's documentation. The last time I tried to play, I noticed that <begin feature enhancement request>.

## Feature Enhancement Request example

There is a problem with some confirmation and notice pop-ups either not fully displaying, or displaying behind certain modals or elements that are not accessible to the player. For example, see the screenshots attached, Where I press "New Journey" and then there is a "Make a Choice" pop-up where I cannot make any choices, and I cannot even exit. This was reported by many of the game testers as "disappointing" and "frustrating".
