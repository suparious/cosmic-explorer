## ðŸŽ® Cosmic Explorer - Web UI Complete!

### Terminal UI Successfully Deprecated âœ…

The game no longer waits for terminal input when using the web interface. All game logic has been adapted for web-based interaction!

### What's Fixed:

1. **No More Terminal Interruptions**
   - Removed all `input()` calls from web gameplay
   - Created `web_navigation()` function that works without prompts
   - Inline quest and event handling

2. **Improved Ambient Music** ðŸŽµ
   - **Base drone layer**: Harmonic series (root, fifth, octave, major third) with slow frequency modulation
   - **Shimmering layer**: High-frequency triangular waves with random panning and amplitude modulation
   - **Cosmic events**: Occasional mysterious space sounds that sweep through the frequency spectrum
   - Music evolves continuously and never repeats exactly!

### Quick Test:

1. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   python api/app.py
   ```

2. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5)

3. **Click anywhere** to start the ambient music

4. **Test the game**:
   - Click "New Journey" 
   - Use "Navigate" - no terminal prompts!
   - Use "Scan" - random events happen instantly
   - Listen to the evolving space music ðŸŽ¶

### The Music Experience:

Instead of a boring constant tone, you'll now hear:
- Deep space drones that slowly shift in pitch
- Sparkling high frequencies that pan left and right
- Occasional "cosmic events" - mysterious sweeping sounds
- All layers blend together for an immersive space atmosphere

Enjoy your fully graphical cosmic adventure! ðŸš€âœ¨
