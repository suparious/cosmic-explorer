## üìà High-Impact Features (3-5 days)

        "rewards": {"wealth": 500},
        "requirements": {"item": 1}
    },
    "exploration": {
        "name": "Discover {count} new nodes",
        "rewards": {"wealth": 300, "item": "star_chart_fragment"},

## üìù Feature Connection Recipe

### Making Systems Work Together:

1. **Quests + Navigation**: "Explore 3 asteroid fields" 
2. **Trading + Combat**: Loot drops based on enemy cargo
3. **Mining + Trading**: Different regions want different materials
4. **Scanning + Quests**: "Scan for distress signals"

### Regional Variety:
```javascript
const REGION_ECONOMIES = {
    "industrial": {
        "wants": ["rare_minerals", "exotic_matter"],
        "supplies": ["ship_parts", "fuel_cells"],
        "priceModifier": 1.2
    },
    "agricultural": {
        "wants": ["technology", "weapons"],
        "supplies": ["food", "organic_compounds"],
        "priceModifier": 0.8
    }
};
```
