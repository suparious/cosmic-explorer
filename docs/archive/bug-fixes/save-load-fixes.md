# Save/Load System Fixes - June 6, 2025

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with the Save/Load system in Cosmic Explorer that were preventing proper functionality.

## Issues Identified

1. **Modal Z-Index Layering**
   - Modals were appearing behind each other due to missing z-index values
   - Modal position was set to `absolute` instead of `fixed`

2. **Exit Button Inconsistency**
   - Different exit button implementations between save and load modals
   - No standardized modal close button component

3. **Load Game Not Working**
   - Game state not updating properly after loading
   - Socket session not being rejoined with correct session ID
   - Ship renderer not updating with loaded state

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. CSS Modal Fixes (`static/css/game.css`)
- Changed modal position from `absolute` to `fixed`
- Added proper z-index hierarchy:
  ```css
  .modal { z-index: 1000; }
  #choice-modal { z-index: 1001; }
  #save-load-modal { z-index: 1002; }
  #pod-mods-modal { z-index: 1003; }
  #food-modal { z-index: 1004; }
  #ship-modal { z-index: 1005; }
  #star-map-modal { z-index: 1006; }
  .notification { z-index: 9999; }
  ```

### 2. Modal Manager Component (`static/js/components/modal.js`)
- Created standardized modal system for consistency
- Provides unified close button behavior
- Handles animations and z-index automatically
- Supports tab systems and overlay click handling
- Manages escape key handling per modal

### 3. Load Game Functionality (`static/js/ui.js`)
Fixed the `loadFromSlot` method to properly:
- Update game engine state and session ID
- Emit `gameStateUpdated` event for all components
- Update HUD and UI components
- Rejoin socket session with correct ID
- Update renderer ship state
- Update music based on loaded state
- Generate new space environment
- Fallback to page reload if game engine not ready

### 4. Additional Improvements
- Added fade-out animation to save/load modal close
- Updated HTML to include modal manager script
- Added test script for save/load functionality
- Updated README.md to reflect Save/Load is implemented

## Testing

Created `tests/test_save_load.py` to verify:
- Creating new games
- Saving to multiple slots
- Listing all saves
- Loading from slots
- Deleting saves
- Save/load data integrity

## Usage

### For Players
- Press F5 or click Save button to save game
- Press F9 or click Load button to load game
- 5 save slots available (Slot 0 is auto-save)
- Save slots show location, turn count, wealth, and health

### For Developers
- Use `window.modalManager` for creating standardized modals
- Modal close buttons now consistent across all modals
- Z-index conflicts resolved automatically

## Future Improvements
- Add cloud save support
- Implement save file compression
- Add save file versioning/migration
- Create save file export/import functionality
