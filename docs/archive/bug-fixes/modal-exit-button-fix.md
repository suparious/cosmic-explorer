# Modal Exit Button and Continue Button Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Exit Buttons Not Working
The modal close buttons weren't working because they were using `window.uiManager` in their onclick handlers, but the global reference was actually `window.gameUI`.

**Fixed by:**
- Changed all modal close button onclick handlers from `window.uiManager` to `window.gameUI`
- Fixed in:
  - Save/Load modal close button and tab buttons
  - Pod Mods modal close button and purchase buttons
  - Food modal close button
  - Ship modal close button and tab buttons
  - Star Map modal close button
  - Dynamic content buttons (delete save, buy ship, buy mod, etc.)

### 2. Continue Button Implementation
The Continue button was hidden by default and needed proper state management to show when there's an active game.

**Fixed by:**
- Added `hasActiveGame` tracking in UIManager
- Update this flag when:
  - Starting a new game (set to true)
  - Loading a game (set to true)
  - Game over/victory (set to false)
  - Receiving game state from server (set to true if not game over)
- Call `updateContinueButtonVisibility()` at key points:
  - After starting new game
  - After loading a game
  - After game over/victory
  - When showing main menu
  - When receiving game state from server
  - On initial load
- Enhanced `continueGame()` method to:
  - Check if there's actually an active game
  - Resume music when continuing
  - Show notification if no active game exists

### 3. Socket Reference Fix
Fixed incorrect socket reference when loading a game.

**Fixed by:**
- Changed `window.gameEngine.socket` to `window.gameEngine.socketHandler.socket`

## How It Works Now

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - When the game loads, it checks if there's an active game
   - The Continue button is hidden by default
   - If the server sends a game state (indicating an active session), the Continue button appears

2. **New Game:**
   - Starting a new game sets `hasActiveGame = true`
   - Continue button becomes visible
   - New Game button loses its primary styling

3. **Loading a Game:**
   - Successfully loading a game sets `hasActiveGame = true`
   - Continue button becomes visible
   - Player is taken directly to the game screen

4. **Using ESC Key:**
   - ESC key still returns to main menu as before
   - The game state is preserved
   - Continue button remains visible if there's an active game

5. **Continue Button:**
   - Only visible when there's an active game
   - Clicking it returns to the game screen
   - Resumes music playback
   - Shows notification if no active game exists

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Modal Close Buttons:**
   - Open any modal (Save/Load, Ship, Pod Mods, etc.)
   - Click the X button - it should close properly
   - Try all tab buttons in multi-tab modals

2. **Continue Button:**
   - Start a new game - Continue button should appear
   - Press ESC to return to menu - Continue button should be visible
   - Click Continue - should return to game
   - After game over - Continue button should disappear
   - Load a saved game - Continue button should appear

3. **Save/Load System:**
   - Save a game in any slot
   - Load the game - should work properly
   - Delete a save - should work properly

All modal interactions and the Continue button functionality should now work as expected!
