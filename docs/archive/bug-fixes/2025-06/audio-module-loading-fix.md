# Audio System Module Loading Fix

## Issue Description

The game was failing to initialize with errors:
- `Cannot use import statement outside a module` in musicEngine.js
- `MusicEngine is not defined` in audio.js

This was caused by a conflict between the old monolithic code and the new modular audio system.

## Root Cause

1. `musicEngine.js` was using ES6 imports but loaded as a regular script tag
2. The modular MusicEngine wasn't available when AudioManager tried to use it
3. AudioManager's init was synchronous but needed to wait for modules to load

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Old Wrapper
Removed the intermediate `musicEngine.js` wrapper and loaded the modular audio system directly:
```html
<!-- Old -->
<script src="js/musicEngine.js"></script>

<!-- New -->
<script type="module" src="js/audio/index.js"></script>
```

### 2. Made AudioManager Init Async
Updated AudioManager to wait for MusicEngine to be available on window object:
```javascript
async init() {
    // Wait for modular MusicEngine to be available
    let attempts = 0;
    while (!window.MusicEngine && attempts < 10) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
        attempts++;
    }
    
    if (!window.MusicEngine) {
        console.error('MusicEngine not available after waiting');
        return;
    }
    
    this.musicEngine = new window.MusicEngine();
    await this.musicEngine.init();
}
```

### 3. Updated GameEngine Init
Made GameEngine properly await AudioManager's async initialization:
```javascript
// Wait for async init to complete
await this.audioManager.init();
```

### 4. Made Audio Non-Critical
Since audio might fail to load (browser restrictions, etc.), made it non-critical:
```javascript
} catch (error) {
    console.error('✗ Failed to create AudioManager:', error);
    // Audio is not critical, continue without it
    console.warn('Continuing without audio support');
}
```

## Benefits

- ✅ No more module loading conflicts
- ✅ Proper async initialization chain
- ✅ Game can continue even if audio fails
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with global MusicEngine

## Testing

1. Clear browser cache
2. Reload the game
3. Check console for successful initialization messages
4. Verify music plays when starting a new game
5. Test sound effects during gameplay

## Files Modified

1. `/templates/index.html` - Updated script loading
2. `/static/js/audio.js` - Made init async and wait for modules
3. `/static/js/game.js` - Properly await audio initialization
