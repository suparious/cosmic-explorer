# Save/Load Overwrite Confirmation Bug Fix
**Date: June 7, 2025**

## 🐛 Bug Description
When attempting to save the game to a slot that already contains a save, the confirmation modal asking "Overwrite Save?" would keep reappearing even after selecting "Yes" or "No". This made it impossible to overwrite existing saves.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The bug was in the `saveToSlot` function in `/static/js/ui.js`. The issue occurred due to improper flow control:

1. When checking if a save slot exists, the code would show the confirmation modal
2. However, the function would continue executing and fall through to the `performSave` call at the bottom
3. This caused the save to execute regardless of the user's choice
4. The successful save would then trigger another save slot check, causing the modal to reappear

## 🔧 Solution Implemented
Fixed the flow control in `saveToSlot` to ensure:
- All code paths that check for existing saves properly return after handling
- Explicit handling of autosave slots (proceed without confirmation)
- Explicit handling of manual save slots (show confirmation modal)
- Proper return statement after showing the modal to prevent fall-through
- Network errors are now handled by attempting the save anyway

## 📝 Code Changes
```javascript
// Before: Missing proper flow control
if (data.success && !data.is_autosave) {
    this.showChoiceModal(...);
    return;
}
// Function would continue to performSave at bottom

// After: Complete flow control
if (data.success) {
    if (data.is_autosave) {
        await this.performSave(slot, sessionId);
    } else {
        this.showChoiceModal(...);
    }
    return; // Prevents fall-through
}
```

## ✅ Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start a game and make some progress
2. Save to slot 1
3. Try to save to slot 1 again
4. Confirm the "Overwrite Save?" modal appears only once
5. Select "Yes" - verify the save completes
6. Try again and select "No" - verify the save is cancelled

## 📄 Files Modified
- `/static/js/ui.js` - Fixed `saveToSlot` function flow control

## 🎯 Impact
Users can now properly overwrite existing saves without the modal appearing multiple times. The save/load system is fully functional.
