# Camera Centering Implementation
**Date: June 10, 2025**

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
The ship/pod was not always visible on screen and the camera wasn't centering on important events like battles or damage.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Implemented

### 1. Camera System Enhancement in `renderer.js`
- **Initial Camera Centering**: Camera now starts centered on the ship position
- **`centerCameraOn(x, y, immediate)`**: New method to center camera on any position
  - `immediate = false`: Smooth transition using existing smoothing
  - `immediate = true`: Instant camera jump
- **`ensureShipVisible()`**: Called every frame to keep ship/pod always centered

### 2. Movement Animation Updates
Updated both `game.js` and `modules/effectsManager.js`:
- **Ship Movement**: Camera target updates during animation to follow ship
- **Pod Movement**: Camera follows pod's erratic movement pattern
- Both animations now call `renderer.centerCameraOn()` to update camera target

### 3. Event-Based Camera Centering
Camera now centers on ship/pod during these events:
- **Combat Events**: `combat_start`, all combat phases
- **Damage Events**: `damage`, `critical_damage`, `danger`
- **Explosion Events**: `explosion`
- **Pod Activation**: `pod_activated`

### 4. Camera Parameters
- **Smoothing Factor**: 0.1 (provides cinematic smooth following)
- **Always Centered**: Ship/pod remains at screen center
- **Event Response**: Immediate centering for critical events

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified
1. `/static/js/renderer.js` - Core camera system enhancements
2. `/static/js/game.js` - Event handlers and movement animations
3. `/static/js/modules/effectsManager.js` - Module version updates

## ðŸŽ® User Experience Impact
- Ship/pod is always visible and centered
- Combat and damage events draw immediate attention
- Smooth camera movement feels professional
- No more losing track of the ship during navigation

## âœ… Testing Checklist
- [ ] Ship stays centered during normal navigation
- [ ] Camera centers on combat start
- [ ] Damage events trigger camera centering
- [ ] Pod ejection centers camera
- [ ] Movement animations update camera smoothly
- [ ] Initial game load centers on ship

The camera system now provides a much more polished and professional gameplay experience!
