# Cosmic Explorer - Refactoring and Enhancement Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Pod Mods Button Fix ✅
- Created `pod_mods_fix.js` to monitor game state changes and ensure button visibility

- The button now correctly shows/hides based on game state

### 2. Combat System Integration ✅
- Connected the existing `combat_system.py` backend with the `combat.js` frontend
- Added combat event handlers in `game.js`
- Combat UI now properly displays when encounters occur
- Players can use different combat actions based on their equipment
- Visual effects and animations implemented

### 3. Mining System Implementation ✅
- Fully implemented mining mechanics in `action_processor.py`
- Added mine button that appears in asteroid fields
- Mining requires Mining Laser equipment
- Includes fuel cost, success/failure outcomes, and bonus finds
- Visual effects when mining

### 4. Salvaging System Implementation ✅
- Implemented salvage mechanics for post-combat and debris fields
- Requires Salvager equipment
- Different salvage tables based on location
- Risk/reward mechanics with possible hazards

### 5. Initial Analysis Complete ✅
- Identified modularization needs
- Found incomplete features
- Documented current architecture issues

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Further Backend Modularization 🔄
The `api/app.py` file is still 17KB. Extract these systems into separate modules:
- **Event System** (`event_system.py`)
  - Random events
  - Quest events
  - Location-based events
- **Trading System** (`trading_system.py`)
  - Market prices
  - Trading posts
  - Supply/demand mechanics
- **Navigation System** (`navigation_system.py`)
  - Star map management
  - Node connections
  - Region transitions
- **Save System** (`save_system.py`)
  - Game state persistence
  - Save/load functionality

### 2. Enhanced Gameplay Features 🎮

#### A. Resource Processing ⚙️
- ~~Mining mechanics~~ ✅ DONE
- ~~Salvaging system~~ ✅ DONE  
- Create resource processing chains (refining minerals, combining components)
- Add crafting system for advanced items

#### B. Quest System
- Implement the quest framework
- Add quest types: delivery, bounty hunting, exploration
- Create quest rewards and progression

#### C. Faction System

#### D. Crew Management
- Hire crew members with different skills
- Crew affects ship performance
- Crew morale and management

### 3. UI/UX Improvements 🎨

#### A. Visual Enhancements
- Ship customization visualization
- Dynamic backgrounds based on region
- Particle effects for different actions
- Combat damage indicators

#### B. Quality of Life
- Hotkeys for common actions
- Auto-save functionality
- Settings persistence
- Tutorial/onboarding

#### C. Audio Improvements
- More dynamic music based on situations
- Combat-specific soundtracks
- Ambient sounds for different regions

### 4. Balance and Polish 🔧

#### A. Economy Balance
- Adjust prices and rewards
- Add market fluctuations
- Create money sinks

#### B. Combat Balance
- Tune enemy difficulty curves
- Balance weapon effectiveness
- Add more enemy varieties

#### C. Progression System
- Ship upgrade paths
- Achievement system
- Unlockable content

## Notes for AI Assistants

When working on this codebase:
1. Always write complete files, not snippets
2. Test each feature in isolation before integration
3. Maintain the modular structure
4. Add proper error handling
5. Update the knowledge graph with significant changes
6. Follow the existing code style and patterns

The goal is to make each module small enough that an AI can easily understand and modify it without needing to comprehend the entire system at once.
