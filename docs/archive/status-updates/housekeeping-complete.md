  - Linting and formatting checks
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Security scanning
  - Build verification

### 5. **Testing**
- âœ… Created test structure with `tests/__init__.py`
- âœ… Added `tests/test_game.py` for game logic tests
- âœ… Added `tests/test_api.py` for API endpoint tests
- âœ… Configured pytest with coverage reporting

### 6. **Script Improvements**
- âœ… Enhanced `start_game.sh` with:
  - Python version checking
  - Automatic dependency installation
  - Environment setup validation

## Recommendations

### Keep These Assistant Files (Optional)
The `docs/assistants/` folder contains Claude-specific configuration files. While they don't belong in a game project, you might want to keep them for reference when working with Claude. Consider:
- Moving them to a separate repository
- Or keeping them in a `.claude/` directory

### Next Steps
1. **Run Setup**: Execute `./dev/setup.sh` to set up the development environment
2. **Install Pre-commit**: Run `pre-commit install` to enable git hooks
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `./dev/test.sh` to ensure everything works
4. **Update Git Remote**: Update the GitHub URLs in files to match your repository

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Setup development environment
./dev/setup.sh

# Or use Make
make setup      # Setup environment
make run        # Start the game
make test       # Run tests
make lint       # Check code style
make format     # Auto-format code
make clean      # Clean generated files
```
