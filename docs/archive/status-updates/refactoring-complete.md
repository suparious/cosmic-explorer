# Cosmic Explorer - Refactored Architecture

## Overview
The Cosmic Explorer codebase has been refactored from a monolithic structure into a modular architecture that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. The refactoring makes it particularly suitable for AI-assisted development.

## Module Structure

### Backend Modules (Python)

#### 1. **ship_system.py** (~300 lines)
Handles all ship-related functionality:
- Ship type definitions (Scout, Trader, Combat, Explorer)
- Ship modification system (high/mid/low/rig slots)
- `ShipManager` class for ship operations
- Ship purchase, mod installation, and stat calculations

#### 2. **inventory_system.py** (~350 lines)
Manages the item and inventory system:
- Item type definitions (trade goods, consumables, components, quest items)
- `InventoryManager` class for inventory operations
- Cargo space calculations
- Item usage, trading, and loot generation

#### 3. **pod_system.py** (~400 lines)
Controls the escape pod mechanics:
- Pod augmentation definitions
- `PodManager` class for pod operations
- Pod activation, damage handling, and augmentation installation
- Pod mode navigation and ship replacement

#### 4. **session_manager.py** (~350 lines)
Manages game sessions and state:
- `GameSession` class containing all player state
- `SessionManager` for multiple concurrent sessions
- Save/load functionality
- Session cleanup and statistics tracking

#### 5. **action_processor.py** (~600 lines)
Processes all game actions:
- `ActionProcessor` class with modular action handlers
- Separate methods for each action type
- Game over condition checking
- Turn effect processing

#### 6. **app_refactored.py** (~400 lines)
Clean Flask API with just routing:
- REST endpoints for game operations
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Minimal business logic (delegates to modules)
- Clear separation from game mechanics

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modularity**
- Each system is self-contained in its own file
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Easy to understand and modify individual systems

### 2. **AI-Assistant Friendly**
- Files are appropriately sized (300-600 lines)
- Clear naming conventions
- Well-documented functions
- Specific files for specific features

### 3. **Maintainability**
- No more 1000+ line files
- Reduced coupling between systems
- Easier to test individual components
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### 4. **Extensibility**
- New ship types can be added to `SHIP_TYPES`
- New items added to `ITEM_TYPES`
- New actions added to `ActionProcessor`
- New pod augmentations in `POD_AUGMENTATIONS`

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Ship Type
```python
# In ship_system.py, add to SHIP_TYPES:
"stealth": {
    "name": "Stealth Corvette",
    "description": "Nearly invisible to scanners",
    "cost": 1500,
    "max_hp": 90,
    "cargo_capacity": 75,
    "fuel_efficiency": 0.7,
    "speed": 1.5,
    "slots": {
        "high": 2,
        "mid": 4,
        "low": 2,
        "rig": 1
    },
    "icon": "ðŸŒ‘"
}
```

### Adding a New Item
```python
# In inventory_system.py, add to ITEM_TYPES:
"cloaking_device": {
    "name": "Cloaking Device",
    "description": "Temporary invisibility module",
    "weight": 3,
    "base_value": 800,
    "category": "component",
    "icon": "ðŸ‘»",
    "stack_size": 1
}
```

### Adding a New Action
```python
# In action_processor.py:
# 1. Add to action_handlers in __init__:
self.action_handlers = {
    # ... existing handlers ...
    "cloak": self.handle_cloak
}

# 2. Implement the handler:
def handle_cloak(self, session, data):
    """Handle cloaking action"""
    # Implementation here
    return {
        "event": "Cloaking engaged!",
        "event_type": "success",
        "choices": []
    }
```

## Missing Features to Implement

### 1. **Combat System**
- Ships have weapons but no combat mechanics
- Need to implement in `action_processor.py`
- Use `combat_power` stat from ship mods

### 2. **Mining System** 
- Mining laser exists but basic implementation
- Expand in `handle_mine()` method
- Add different asteroid types and yields

### 3. **Salvage System**
- Salvager mod exists but not implemented
- Add wreck generation and salvage mechanics
- Implement in `handle_salvage()`

### 4. **Quest System**
- Quest items exist but no quest mechanics
- Need quest definitions and progression
- Implement in `handle_quest()`

### 5. **Faction/Reputation System**
- No faction tracking currently
- Add to `GameSession` class
- Affect trading prices and encounters

### 6. **Crew Management**
- No crew system exists
- Could add crew members with skills
- Affect ship performance

## Frontend Improvements Needed

### 1. **Modularize game.js**
- Currently 23KB in one file
- Split into: navigation.js, inventory.js, ship.js, ui-components.js

### 2. **Fix Pod Mods Button**
- Known visibility issue (see POD_MODS_DEBUG.js)
- Likely state management problem

### 3. **Add Visual Ship Differentiation**
- Ships have icons but not used in UI
- Add ship visuals/animations

### 4. **Enhance Audio System**
- audio.js and musicEngine.js exist but underutilized
- Add more sound effects and dynamic music

## Development Guidelines

1. **Keep modules focused** - Each file should handle one system
2. **Use the managers** - Don't directly modify game state
3. **Document new features** - Add docstrings and update this file
4. **Test modularly** - Each system can be tested independently
5. **Maintain separation** - Don't add game logic to app.py

## Next Steps

1. Replace the old app.py with app_refactored.py
2. Test all functionality to ensure nothing broke
3. Implement missing features (combat, mining, salvage)
4. Modularize the frontend JavaScript
5. Add more immersive content (story, events, audio)
6. Create unit tests for each module

This refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for continued development and makes the codebase much more accessible for both human developers and AI assistants.
