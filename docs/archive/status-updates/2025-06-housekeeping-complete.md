## ðŸ”§ Bug Fix: Save/Load Modal Persistence Issue

### Problem
When loading a saved game, notifications and choice modals from the previous game state (particularly from selling items) were persisting and appearing after the load completed. This created a confusing user experience where old UI elements would appear in the new game session.

### Root Cause
- WebSocket events with choices would create modals that weren't properly cleared
- Modal state was persisting across game sessions when loading saves
- The `loadFromSlot` function wasn't cleaning up UI state before loading

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Modal Cleanup**: Added `closeAllModals()` call before loading game state
2. **Improved Modal Management**: Updated `closeAllModals()` to:
   - Clear choice modal content
   - Reset active modals tracking
   - Reset modal z-index
3. **Added Delays**: Small delays ensure modals are fully removed before state updates
4. **Screen Transition Updates**: Updated `showScreen()` to properly handle modal cleanup

### Files Modified
- `/static/js/ui.js` - Enhanced modal management functions

## ðŸŽ® Testing the Fix
To verify the save/load fix:
1. Start a game and navigate to a trade location
2. Begin selling an item (modal appears)
3. Save the game while the modal is open
4. Load a different save
5. Confirm no old modals appear

The game is now stable and ready for continued development!
