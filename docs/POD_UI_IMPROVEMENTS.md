# Pod Augmentation UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Pod Mods Button Visibility
- The "Pod Mods" button now appears immediately after buying a pod (previously hidden)
- When `just_bought_pod` flag is true, the button shows as disabled with helpful text
- Button text changes to "Pod Mods (Navigate First)" when disabled
- Clicking the disabled button shows a notification explaining the requirement

### 2. Enhanced User Feedback
- Updated pod purchase message to include: "Navigate once before installing augmentations"
- Added tooltip on Pod Mods button explaining the state
- Pod indicator in top-right is now clickable to show pod status and installed augmentations

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Added CSS for disabled button state (opacity 0.6, no hover effects)
- Disabled buttons have a different border color for clarity
- Maintained the pulsing "available" animation for when augmentations can be purchased

## How It Works Now

1. **Buy Pod**: Player purchases pod and sees message about needing to navigate first
2. **See Pod Mods Button**: Button appears immediately but is disabled with helpful text
3. **Navigate Once**: After one navigation action, the restriction is lifted
4. **Purchase Augmentations**: Button becomes active and opens the augmentation modal
5. **Track Progress**: Click pod indicator to see installed augmentations

## Benefits

- No more confusion about where the Pod Mods option is
- Clear communication about the navigation requirement
- Better visual feedback for button states
- Quick access to pod information via the indicator

This makes the pod augmentation system much more discoverable and user-friendly!
