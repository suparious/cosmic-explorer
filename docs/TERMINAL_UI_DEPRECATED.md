# Cosmic Explorer - Terminal UI Deprecation Notice

## ðŸš€ We've Gone Full Web!

The original terminal-based UI has been deprecated in favor of the beautiful web interface. 

### What Changed?

1. **No More Terminal Input**: All game interactions now happen through the web browser
   - `navigation.py` - Terminal input replaced with web-compatible functions
   - `events.py` - Quest and event prompts now handled by the web UI
   - `game.py` - Main game loop no longer used for web version

2. **Web API Integration**: The Flask backend (`api/app.py`) now includes:
   - `web_navigation()` - Handles navigation without terminal prompts
   - Inline quest generation - No more `input()` calls
   - Inline random events - Direct stat modifications

### Running the Game

The game now runs exclusively through the web interface:

```bash
python api/app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

### Original Terminal Version

If you want to run the original terminal version:

```bash
python game.py
```

**Note**: The terminal version is preserved for historical purposes but is no longer maintained.

### Features Comparison

| Feature | Terminal UI | Web UI |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Graphics | ASCII art | Canvas animations |
| Sound | None | Dynamic audio |
| Input | Terminal prompts | Click/keyboard |
| Updates | Screen refresh | Real-time WebSocket |
| Visuals | Text only | Particles, sprites |

### Audio Improvements

The ambient music now features:
- **Harmonic drone layers** with slow frequency evolution
- **Shimmering high frequencies** that pan across stereo field
- **Occasional cosmic events** - mysterious space sounds
- **Dynamic composition** - never repeats exactly

Much better than that lazy single tone! ðŸŽµ

### Future

All new features will be developed for the web UI only. The terminal version remains as a testament to the game's origins but won't receive updates.

Welcome to the future of Cosmic Explorer! ðŸŒŸ
