# Testing Pod Augmentation Improvements

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Start the game** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd /home/shaun/repos/cosmic-explorer
   ./start_game.sh
   ```

2. **Navigate to a planet/outpost** to reach a repair location

3. **Buy a Pod** (500 wealth required):
   - You should see the "Buy Pod" button
   - After purchase, notice the message mentions navigating first
   - The "Pod Mods (Navigate First)" button should appear but be disabled

4. **Try clicking the disabled button**:
   - You'll see a notification explaining you need to navigate first

5. **Navigate once** (to anywhere)

6. **Return to a repair location**:
   - The "Pod Mods" button should now be active and glowing

7. **Click "Pod Mods"** to open the augmentation modal:
   - You'll see 4 augmentations available:
     - üõ°Ô∏è Shield Boost Matrix (300 wealth)
     - üì° Advanced Scanner Array (400 wealth)  
     - üì¶ Emergency Cargo Module (500 wealth)
     - üöÄ Emergency Thrusters (250 wealth)

8. **Test the pod indicator** (top-right):
   - Click on the pod indicator to see status
   - After buying augmentations, it will show the count and names

## What Was Fixed

- **Discoverability**: The Pod Mods button now appears immediately (disabled at first)
- **Clear Instructions**: Button text and notifications guide you through the process
- **Better Feedback**: Visual states clearly show when actions are available
- **Quick Info**: Click pod indicator for instant status check

The augmentation system was always there - it just needed better UI to make it accessible!
