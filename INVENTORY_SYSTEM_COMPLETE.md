# Cosmic Explorer - Inventory & Ship Customization System

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive inventory and ship customization system for Cosmic Explorer, inspired by Eve Online's fitting system. This adds significant depth to the game while maintaining its accessible nature.

## New Features

Four distinct ship classes, each with unique characteristics:

  - Fast and fuel-efficient (80% fuel usage, 120% speed)
  - Small cargo capacity (50 units)
  - Slots: 2 High, 3 Mid, 1 Low, 1 Rig
  - Perfect for exploration

- **Merchant Cruiser** (üö¢) - $800
  - Massive cargo hold (200 units)
  - Slower and less fuel-efficient
  - Slots: 1 High, 2 Mid, 4 Low, 2 Rig
  - Ideal for trading runs

- **Combat Frigate** (‚öîÔ∏è) - $1,200
  - High HP (150) and combat-focused

## How to Play

## Technical Implementation

- Full backend support in Flask API

## Balance Considerations

- Ship costs scale with capabilities

This system transforms Cosmic Explorer from a simple space adventure into a deep, strategic experience where every decision matters - from choosing your ship type to managing your cargo hold!
