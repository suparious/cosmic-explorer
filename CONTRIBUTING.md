## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/OWNER/cosmic-explorer/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - System information (OS, Python version, browser)

### Suggesting Features

1. Check if the feature has been suggested in [Issues](https://github.com/OWNER/cosmic-explorer/issues)
2. Create a new issue with the "enhancement" label
3. Describe the feature and why it would be useful
4. Include mockups or examples if applicable

### Code Contributions

1. **Find an issue to work on** or create one for your planned changes
2. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Write or update tests** for your changes
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly
6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for all classes and functions

Example:
```python
def calculate_damage(
    attacker_power: int,
    defender_armor: int,
    critical_hit: bool = False
) -> int:
    """
    Calculate damage dealt in combat.
    
    Args:
        attacker_power: Base attack power
        defender_armor: Defense armor rating
        critical_hit: Whether this is a critical hit
        
    Returns:
        Final damage amount
    """
    base_damage = max(1, attacker_power - defender_armor)
    if critical_hit:
        base_damage *= 2
    return base_damage
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use 2 spaces for indentation

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Render a particle effect at the given position
 * @param {number} x - X coordinate
 * @param {number} y - Y coordinate
 * @param {string} type - Type of particle effect
 */
const renderParticle = (x, y, type) => {
  const particle = new Particle(x, y, type);
  particles.push(particle);
};
```

### CSS Code Style

- Use CSS variables for colors and common values
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested
- Group related properties

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs (e.g., "Fix #123")
- Structure:
  ```
  Short summary of changes (max 72 chars)

  More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 chars.
  Explain the problem this commit solves.

  Fixes #123
  ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_game.py

# Run tests in watch mode
python -m pytest-watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when changing existing functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Submitting Changes

1. **Update your feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
